PonyTown Info:

The best place for you to find us would be Hermit Hill. We frequent there incredibly often.

We are a system! Please respect our boundaries! If someone's name tells you to IWC, do that!

Crowns and boops are very appreciated! Please do not kiss. If the name of our pony says C+H, you can do that.

Sometimes we're active, sometimes we're AFK. Feel free to whisper, but we are perfectly fine with public chat!

Please DNI if you are below 16.
