PonyTown General Info (TRADE DETAILS BELOW THIS):

The best place for you to find us would be Hermit Hill. We frequent there incredibly often.

We are a system! Please respect our boundaries! If someone's name tells you to IWC, do that!

Crowns and boops are very appreciated! Please do not kiss ANY of our ponies.

Sometimes we're active, sometimes we're AFK. Feel free to whisper, but we are perfectly fine with public chat!

We are 22. If you are under 17, please be aware that while we may interact with you casually, we will not be close friends with you for your own safety. Take care of yourselves online.

PONY TRADES: OPEN

RULES:

We also take art as payment for trades. If you go this route, we will likely ask you to draw an OC or something related to our fanfiction.

No requesting NSFW ponies. Note: This does not mean no requesting NSFW fandoms. For example, requesting a pony of Kyu from Huniepop or Generica from Crush Crush is fine, but requesting an explicitly naked pony is not. Along with that, ponies with blood/gore/body horror are completely fine, as we have no issue with making that.

Files/screenshots will only be given once you have shown proof that your pony/art has also been completed. WIPs during the process of creation are very appreciated, and we will send you them as well.

We will not trade with you if you clearly do not have a style and are just using default choices/no shading. You need to put effort in if you want to receive a pony. Note: If you are new to the game and trying to figure out how to make a pony, it might just be better to ask us for advice and tips, not a trade.
