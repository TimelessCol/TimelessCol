PonyTown Info:

The best place for you to find us would be Hermit Hill. We frequent there incredibly often.

We are a system! Please respect our boundaries! If someone's name tells you to IWC, do that!

Crowns and boops are very appreciated! Please do not kiss. If the name of our pony says C+H, you can do that.

Sometimes we're active, sometimes we're AFK. Feel free to whisper, but we are perfectly fine with public chat!

We are 21. If you are under 17, please be aware that while we may interact with you casually, we will not be close friends with you for your own safety. Take care of yourselves online.
